the graces website was developed with react with an eye toward ease of maintenance.

the main page contain an array of event objects in its component state, each of which contains an 
event date, event flyer image path, and brief event description. these event objects are automatically 
rendered to the page under either an 'upcoming events' or 'previous events' heading, depending on the 
current date.

playful css transitions animate the drawings, all of which are original.
